      "Comment: The underlying reason the the EKF is the defacto standard is that the difficulty in all nonlinear Kalman type filters is the process of linearization Julier and Uhlmanns filter is a good one however they have said too much and many of the things they publish have been disputed  Firstly the UKF is a special example of something called a linear regression kalman filter though they rebutt that so is a Particle Filter which predates the Kalman Filter  The EKF relies on Taylor Series to perform linearization and the UKF relies on linear regression the main difference between the UKF and the LRKF is that the LRKF selects samples about the mean randomly and the UKF uses the so called Unscented Transform which picks points based on the linearly independant vectors of the matrix square root  This is nice and helps improve the performance of the sampling algorithm  It doesnt really dethrone the ekf though  Thats just my opinion\n",

    "At first, I had anticipated that female hate comments would receive lower toxicity scores than male hate comments, even if there may be a bias in the model to downplay the severity of hate toward women. However, my investigation disproved this assumption, and I was surprised to see that there was no obvious difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "The outcome of the means for the toxicity ratings for both boys and females was one aspect of my investigation that I found perplexing. I'm not exactly clear what \"nan,\" the outcome, implies. I need to look into this further because it might have an impact on my actual result.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have a lot of unanswered worries about the potential for bias in machine learning models overall as a result of this effort. Despite the fact that I found no evidence of prejudice in the inquiry I conducted, I am aware that biases can take many various shapes and are frequently not immediately apparent. This gets me thinking about the wider implications of using machine learning to decision-making and how we might ensure that these models are as impartial as feasible."
