## Goal
The goal of this project is to collect and analyze data on the population of European cities within city limits. The data is sourced from a Wikipedia page and is processed using the `pandas` and `BeautifulSoup` libraries in Python. The resulting DataFrame is then analyzed and visualized using the `matplotlib` library to create a horizontal bar chart showing the population of each city.
